# mechatronics Readme

This repository contains all the necessary code to run the mechatronics project for our team that is designed to estimate upper body joint positions using a magnetometer.

First, create a catkin workspace (wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)

```mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src```
```cd ~/catkin_ws/src```
```catkin_init_workspace```

Then, in the directory `catkin_ws/src/`, execute

```git clone https://github.com/rjgriffin42/mechatronics```

This adds the directory "mechatronics", which is where the project is contained.

An alternative is to clone this repository, cd into scripts, and run "./install_project.sh" TODO
